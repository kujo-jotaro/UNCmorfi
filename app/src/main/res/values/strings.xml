            \tWe are two very hungry FaMAF students.\n\n

        <item>Why is the menu not updated?</item>
        <item>
            \tWe get the menu from the university\'s website:\n\n
            www.unc.edu.ar/vida-estudiantil/men%C3%BA-de-la-semana\n\n
            \tIf the menu doesn\'t refresh, it must be because the university did not update it.
        </item>

        <item>Where do they get Balance and Meter information?</item>
        <item>
            \tFrom the university cafeteria\'s website:\n\n
            \tBalance: comedor.unc.edu.ar/autoconsulta.php\n\n
            \tMeter: comedor.unc.edu.ar/cocina.php
        </item>

        <item>¿Windows? ¿How estimates work?</item>
        <item>
            \tThere are \"windows\" (or rather columns) along the cafeteria,
            you have to put the length of the row in front of you, measured in number of windows,
            on the slide bar. For example, at the height of the men's baths there are 5 windows 
            (6 for women's), the total length of the dining room are 12 windows, the point
            where the row curves is 1 window and in the second entrance are 25 windows. 
            This is very experimental functionality.
            It works with a simple quadratic function calculated from a statistic.
            Although the fewer people you have ahead the more accurate it is, the 
            changing nature of the cafeteria\'s line makes it difficult to give an accurate estimate.
            We choose "windows" as a measurement value because they will never change over time,
            but curves and countercurves in a row always vary from day to day.

        <item>How do I apply for the credential? How can I regenerate the credential?</item>
        <item>
            \tRead the website of the cafeteria:\n
            https://www.unc.edu.ar/vida-estudiantil/c%C3%B3mo-solicitar-la-credencial
        </item>

        <item>What does \"Barcode dependencies are not yet available.\" mean?</item>
        <item>
            \tTo add a card using the camera, we use Google Play Services\'s \"Vision\" library.
            If this library is not available on the device, it will be downloaded automatically in
            the background (keep in mind that you need storage space available for the download, if you
            don\'t have enough space, a warning will appear).\n\n
            \tTry again after a few minutes. If you are in a hurry or don\'t have Google Play Services,
            you can add it manually by entering the code with the keyboard.
        </item>

        <item>Why are Internet and camera permissions needed?</item>
        <item>
            \tInternet access is necessary for updating the menu, the balance and the
            ration meter.\n
            \tCamera access is for adding the card by scanning the barcode on it.
        </item>

        <item>Do I need Internet to check my card balance?</item>
        <item>
            \tAll the data is stored on the device to check offline, but you need to be connected to
            the Internet to update it.
        </item>

        <item>Can I eat twice a day?</item>
        <item>
            No.
        </item>

        <item>¿What is the bell that rings every so often in the dining room?</item>
        <item>
            Legend has it that when the bell rings there is rotation among the cooks.
        </item>

        <item>How can I collaborate?</item>
        <item>
            \tYou can send your suggestion by e-mail in the \"Contact\" option of the side menu.\n\n

            \tYou can also have a look at the source code in Github:\n
                \t\tgithub.com/AIDEA775/UNCmorfi\n\n

            \tAnd you can recommend the app to anyone you see in the cafeteria\'s line ;)
